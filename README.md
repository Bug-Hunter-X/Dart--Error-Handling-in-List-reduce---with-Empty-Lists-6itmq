# Dart: Handling Empty Lists in reduce()
This example demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method on an empty list in Dart.  The `reduce()` method requires at least one element to perform the reduction; attempting to use it on an empty list will result in an error.
The solution involves checking for an empty list before calling `reduce()` to prevent this error.  This is a simple yet crucial step to ensure the robustness of your Dart code.
